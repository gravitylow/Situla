Pull-Requests
-------
* Remember to copy the formatting already present in the file you're modifying
* Never use tabs. Use spaces instead. Your IDE should have options for this.
* Python files - indent 4 spaces
* HTML files - indent 2 spaces
* If you don't know why X is done the way it is, ask! Ideally you should talk over your changes in IRC before PR'ing
